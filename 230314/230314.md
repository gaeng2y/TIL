## Continuation

> `struct CheckedContinuation<T, E> where E : [Error](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/error)`
A mechanism to interface between synchronous and asynchronous code, logging correctness violations.
> 

A *continuation* is an opaque representation of program state. To create a continuation in asynchronous code, call the `withUnsafeContinuation(function:_:)` or `withUnsafeThrowingContinuation(function:_:)` function. To resume the asynchronous task, call the `resume(returning:)`, `resume(throwing:)`, `resume(with:)`, or `resume()` method.

<aside>
💡 **Important**

You must call a resume method exactly once on every execution path throughout the program.

## AsyncSequence / AsyncStream

### AsyncSequence

> `@rethrows protocol AsyncSequence`
A type that provides asynchronous, sequential, iterated access to its elements.
> 

An `AsyncSequence` resembles the `Sequence` type — offering a list of values you can step through one at a time — and adds asynchronicity. An `AsyncSequence` may have all, some, or none of its values available when you first use it. Instead, you use `await` to receive values as they become available.

### AsyncStream

> `struct AsyncStream<Element>`
An asynchronous sequence generated from a closure that calls a continuation to produce new elements.
> 

`AsyncStream` conforms to `AsyncSequence`, providing a convenient way to create an asynchronous sequence without manually implementing an asynchronous iterator. In particular, an asynchronous stream is well-suited to adapt callback- or delegation-based APIs to participate with `async`-`await`.

### for-await

```swift
for await i in Counter(howHigh: 10) {
    print(i, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"

let found = await Counter(howHigh: 10).contains(5) // true

let stream = Counter(howHigh: 10)
    .map { $0 % 2 == 0 ? "Even" : "Odd" }
for await s in stream {
    print(s, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints "Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even Odd Even"
```

## Actor

`@Sendable`인 공유 자원을 소지한 타입

```swift
class Counter {
    var count: Int = 0
    
    func increment() {
        self.count += 1  // data racing!!
    }
}

let counter = Counter()
// global
DispatchQueue.global().async {
     counter.increment()
}
// main
counter.increment()
```

actor : prevent shared mutable state

```swift
actor Counter {
		// isolated
    var count: Int = 0
    
    func increment() {
        self.count += 1
    }
}

func someFunction() async {
		let counter = Counter()
		await counter.increment()
}
```

## Sendable

> A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying.

`@Sendable`

You can safely pass values of a sendable type from one concurrency domain to another — for example, you can pass a sendable value as the argument when calling an actor’s methods. All of the following can be marked as sendable:

- Value types
- Reference types with no mutable storage
- Reference types that internally manage access to their state
- Functions and closures (by marking them with `@Sendable`)

Although this protocol doesn’t have any required methods or properties, it does have semantic requirements that are enforced at compile time. These requirements are listed in the sections below. Conformance to `Sendable` must be declared in the same file as the type’s declaration.
